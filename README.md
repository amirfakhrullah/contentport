urgent & often requested:
- support creating threads
- showing OG images when pasting URLs
- becoming responsive
- make it much easier to upgrade to PRO & improved upgrading UX

nice to have
- use posted tweets as style reference/context for assistant
- web browsing for assistant
- voice input for assistant
- peronalize ideas shown as examples ("It would be AMAZING if these examples weren’t random but instead based on my background, who I am, what I do, and what’s happening out there in X that I could speak about."
